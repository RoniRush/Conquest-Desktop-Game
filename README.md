# Conquest-Game
Conquest is a strategic desktop game developed with javaFX

In an imaginary world, there is a map of territories that players must occupy. The progression of time in this world is measured in regular cycles instead of events happening. (You can treat the cycle as a round in the game where players perform)

Each surface cell is characterized by the amount of ore that provide a certain yield over each time cycle.
The ore extraction in the various territories eventually translates into a currency transfer to the merchant, who is accumulated for the benefit of the surface cell owners.
Each territory cell, accordingly, is defined by the amount of military force required to protect and include it within the state's borders.

Each participant runs an army of units of various types, with varying "firepower".
By placing and displaying sufficient military capability, he protects his territories as well as purports to conquer territories from his rivals.
At the beginning of the game each competitor starts with a certain amount of money (the same as all players).
He must choose which army he wants to assemble, as well as which territories he takes over by placing a sufficient number of military units according to the requirements of each field cell.

The game ends when several rounds are set as predefined.
The winner, then, will be the competitor who controls at the end of the game in the amount of terrain cells that yields the maximum money.

there are 3 available themes in the game:
